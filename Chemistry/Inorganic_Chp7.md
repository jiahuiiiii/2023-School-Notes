## Preliminary Examination

### I Appearance of Substances

- Substances contained can't be deduced simply from its appearance.
- Many transition metal ions can have different color depending on the particular compound it's in.

### VI Tests for Acids and Alkalis

#### Test for Acids in solution

| Test                                                 | Positive result                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Add universal indicator to the acid               | Red or orange color appears showing an acid PH (less than 7) |
| 2. Dip a piece of blue litmus paper in the acid      | Blue litmus paper turns red                                  |
| 3. Add solid or aqueous sodium carbonate to the acid | Bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are produced which turn limewater milky |
| 4. Add a piece of magnesium ribbon to the acid       | Bubbles of hydrogen gas are produced which burn with a 'pop' sound |

#### Test for Alkalis in solution

| Test                                                    | Positive result                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Add universal indicator to the alkali                | Blue or purple color appears showing an alkaline PH (greater than 7) |
| 2. Dip a piece of red litmus paper in the acid          | Red litmus paper turns blue                                  |
| 3. Add a little solid ammonium chloride and warm gently | Ammnia gas is produced which turns damp red litmus paper blue |
