#### Group

| Group    | Name                 |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Group 1  | Alkali Metal         |
| Group 2  | Alkaline Earth Metal |
| Group 17 | Halogens             |
| Group 18 | Noble Gases          |

- The vertical columns of Periodic Table
- There're **18 groups** (Group 1 - 18) arranged according to the number of valence electrons.
- All members of the same group have the **same number of valence electrons**.
- Members of a group have **similar chemical properties**. Their physical properties may show gradual change when descending group.

#### Period

- The horizontal rows are called periods.
- There're **7 periods**.
- Period number is indicated by **number of filled electron shells**.
- All elements in the same period have the **same number of filled electron shells**.

## Pattern in the Periodic Table - Group

### Group 1 (Group IA, alkali metals)

#### Physical Properties

1. **Soft metals** which can be easily cut with knife
   - Number of delocalized electron is lesser compared to other metals, the metallic bond is weaker
2. **Silvery** solids with **shiny** surface
3. **Lower melting / boiling point** compared to other metals.
4. **Lower density** compared to other metals
5. Good **conductivity** of heat and electricity

##### Trend in physical properties when going down the group

| Characteristic                  | Trend     | Reason                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Atomic size                  | Increases | The number of electron shells increases when descending the group. |
| 2. Density                      | Increases | Mass increases faster than the increase in radius.           |
| 3. Melting point / Boling point | Decreases | - Atomic size increases. <br/>- The distance between single delocalized electron and positive atoms is increased.<br/>- Metallic bond between atoms become weaker. |
| 4. Electropositivity            | Increases | - Electropositivity: a measurement of the ability of an atom to lose an electron and form a cation. <br/>- Atomic size increases. <br/>- The attractive force between the positive nucleus and the single valence electron becomes weaker. <br/>- The atom loses electron more easily. |

#### Chemical Properties

- Each group 1 elements have **similar chemical properties** because of all having 1 valence electron.
- All group 1 elements are **very reactive metals**, they will **release a valence electron** to form 1+ ion to **achieve octet electron arrangement**.
  - M —> M^+^ + e^-^ (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr)
- Their **chemical reactivity** is different. It depends on how easily it can **donate its valence electron**.
- The ***reactivity** of group 1 elements **increases when going down the group***, because:
  - *The number of shells increases, so the **atomic size increases***
  - *The valence electron in the outermost shell gets further away from nucleus, causing **attractive force** of proton to valence electron becoming **weaker**.*
  - *Thus, the valence electron can be released **easily**.*

#### Chemical Reactions

![6_Chemical Reactions of Group 1 Elements](C:\Users\wongj\Documents\2023\Notes\Chemistry\assets\6_Chemical Reactions of Group 1 Elements.png)

### Group 17 (Group VIIA, halogens)

- Group 17 elements: Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I), Astatine (At)
- The halogens molecules exist as **diatomic molecules**: F~2~, Cl~2~, Br~2~, I~2~, At~2~

#### Physical Properties

1. All Group 17 elements are non-metals. They exist as diatomic molecules.
2. They're **non-conductors** of heat and electricity.
3. Low density.
4. **Low melting and boiling point**, because the halogen molecules are attracted by **weak van der Waals force**.
   - van der Waals force ∝ molecule size
   - I~2(s)~ > Br~2(l)~ > Cl~2(g)~ > F~2(g)~    [at 25℃]

##### Trend in physical properties when going down the group

| Characteristic                | Trend     | Reason                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Atomic radius                 | Increases | The number of electron shells increases when descending the group. |
| Density                       | Increases | Mass increases faster than the increase in radius.           |
| Melting point / Boiling point | Increases | - Molecular size increases. <br/>- Causes van der Waals force between the molecules become stronger.<br/>- More heat is required to overcome the attractive force. |
| Electronegativity             | Decreases | - Atomic radius increases. <br/>- Causes the attractive force between the nucleus and the valence electrons becomes weaker. <br/>- Hence, the ability of atoms to attract electrons decreases. |

###### *Electronegativity

![6_electronegativity](C:\Users\wongj\Documents\2023\Notes\Chemistry\assets\6_electronegativity.png)

- A measure of the **tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons**.
- When two atoms with different electronegativity bond covalently, the electron pair will be pulled more to the atom with higher electronegativity.
- The Pauling scale is most commonly used. Fluorine (the most electronegative element) is assigned a value of 4.0, and values ranges down to francium which is the least electronegative at 0.7.
- **F > O > Cl > N > Br > I > S > C > H > metals** 
- No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a pure non-polar covalent bond.
- A small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond.
- A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond.

#### Chemical Properties

- Each of Group 17 elements have **similar chemical properties** because all atoms have 7 valence electrons.
- All group 17 elements are very reactive non-metals. An atom of group 17 elements will **accept an valence electron** to form 1- ion to **achieve octet electron arrangement**.
  - X~2~ + 2e^-^ —> 2X^-^ (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
- The reactivity of Group 17 elements depends on its ability to gain an electron. ***The reactivity decreases when going down the group***, because:
  - *The number of shells increases so the atomic radius of group 17 elements increases down the group.*
  - *The valence electron in the outermost shell gets further away from the nucleus, thus causes attractive force of proton to valence electron becomes weaker.*
  - *The ability of a halogen atom to attract electron decreases from fluorine to astatine.*

#### Chemical Reactions

##### (i) Group 17 elements react with water to produce acid

| Halogen  | Observation: Solubility                  | Observation: Effect on Litmus Paper                  | Equation                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Chlorine | Dissolves rapidly; light yellow solution | Blue turns red, then decolorized                     | Cl~2(g)~ + H~2~O~(l)~  ⇌ HCl~(aq)~ + HOCl~(aq)~ |
| Bromine  | Dissolves slowly; reddish brown solution | Blue turns red, then decolorized after a longer time | Br~2(g)~ + H~2~O~(l)~  ⇌ HBr~(aq)~ + HOBr~(aq)~ |
| Iodine   | Dissolves slightly; pale brown solution  | Blue turns red, is not decolorized                   | I~2(g)~ + H~2~O~(l)~  ⇌ Hl~(aq)~ + HOI~(aq)~    |

##### (ii) Group 17 elements react with sodium hydroxide to produce water and salt

- Cl~2(g)~ + 2NaOH~(aq)~ —> NaCl~(aq)~ + NaClO~(aq)~ + H~2~O~(l)~
- Br~2(g)~ + 2NaOH~(aq)~ —> NaBr~(aq)~ + NaBrO~(aq)~ + H~2~O~(l)~
- l~2(g)~ + 2NaOH~(aq)~ —> Nal~(aq)~ + NalO~(aq)~ + H~2~O~(l)~

### Group 18 (Group VIIIA, noble gases / inert gases)

- Group 18 elements: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn)

#### Physical Properties

1. All noble gases are **insoluble** in water.
2. They're **non-conductors** of heat and electricity.
3. Very **low density**. Due to the atoms are very far apart.
4. The **density** of noble gases **increases** when descending the group, due to the atomic mass increases faster than the increase in radius.
5. Noble gases have **very low melting and boiling point**. This is because noble gases exist as **monoatomic molecules** which are attracted by **weak van der Waals forces**, less energy is required to overcome the forces.
6. However, the **melting and boiling point increases** when going down the group, because atomic size increases, causing van der Waals forces stronger and more energy is required to overcome the forces.

#### Chemical Properties

1. They exist as **monoatomic molecules** (single atoms) because the atom does **not lose, gain or share electrons**.
2. Noble gases are **chemically inert** (unreactive) because the atoms have achieved **duplet electron arrangement** for helium and **octet electron arrangement** for others.
