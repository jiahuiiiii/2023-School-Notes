# Chapter 4 - Acids, Bases, Salts and Volumetric Analysis

 ## Solution

### Aqueous solution

- Solution: homogenous mixture
- In a solution, a solute is dissolved in a solvent
- Water is the "universal solvent"
  - aqueous solution
- Substance can be dissolve in water in different ways
  - ionic compounds dissolve in water by dissociation, where water surrounds the separated ions, e.g. NaCl
  - Molecular compounds interact with water, but most do NOT dissociate. e.g. sucrose form hydrogen bonding with water when dissolved

### Electrolytic properties of aqueous solution

* Solubility and Electrolyte Strength do not relevant

  ​	For instance, it's possible that a compound is a strong electrolyte, but just not very soluble.

#### Types of electrolytes

1. Non electrolytes

   - substances that dissolve in water but do not produce ions
   - do not conduct electricity
   - present in solution as molecules
   - e.g. CH~3~OH, acetone, alcohol (covalent compound)

2. Strong electrolytes

   - substances that dissociated completely in water

   - good conductors

   - present in solution as ions

   - $$
     \ce{NaCl_{(aq)} -> Na+_{(aq)} + Cl-_{(aq)}}
     $$

   -  including strong acids, strong bases, and most salts

3. Weak electrolytes

   - substances that dissociates partially in water

   - poor conductors

   - different weak electrolytes dissociated to different extents

   - $$
     \ce{CH3COOH_{(aq)} <=> CH3COO-_{(aq)} + H+_{(aq)}}

## Acids

### Arrhenius Acid-Base

Reference: [Overview of Acids and Bases - Chemistry LibreTexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Acids_and_Bases/Acid/Overview_of_Acids_and_Bases)

#### Definition of Arrhenius

- Arrhenius Acid: An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to produce hydrogen ions (H^+^). 
- Arrhenius Base:  A base is a substance that dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH^-^).

##### Examples

- Acidic substance: when hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolves in water, it forms H^+^ ions and chloride ions (Cl^-^), increasing the concentration of H^+^~(aq)~.
- Neutral substance: self-ionization of pure water produces equal concentration of H^+^~(aq)~ and OH^-^~(aq)~
- Basic substance: when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it forms Na^+^ ions and OH^-^ ions, increasing the concentration of OH^-^~(aq)~.

#### Limitations

It only applies to **aqueous solutions** and does not account for other types of acid-base reactions or substances that do not produce H+ or OH- ions. Later theories, such as the **Brønsted-Lowry theory** and the **Lewis theory**, expanded upon and refined the understanding of acids and bases beyond the limitations of the Arrhenius theory.

##### Brønsted-Lowry theory (not important KEKW)

1. Definition of acids and bases:
   - Arrhenius theory: Acids are substances that produce hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water, while bases are substances that produce hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissolved in water.
   - Brønsted-Lowry theory: Acids are substances that donate protons (H+ ions), while bases are substances that accept protons.
2. Scope of applicability:
   - Arrhenius theory: It focuses on acid-base reactions in aqueous solutions and relies on the presence of water as the solvent.
   - Brønsted-Lowry theory: It is more general and applies to acid-base reactions in any solvent, not just water.
3. Proton transfer:
   - Arrhenius theory: It does not explicitly address the concept of proton transfer and relies on the ionization of acids and bases in water.
   - Brønsted-Lowry theory: It emphasizes the transfer of protons between acids and bases. According to this theory, an acid donates a proton, and a base accepts a proton.
4. Conjugate acid-base pairs:
   - Arrhenius theory: It does not specifically define conjugate acid-base pairs.
   - Brønsted-Lowry theory: It introduces the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs, where an acid and its conjugate base differ by the presence or absence of a proton. In a reaction, the acid donates a proton to form its conjugate base, while the base accepts a proton to form its conjugate acid.
5. Acidic and basic properties:
   - Arrhenius theory: It primarily focuses on the ionization of acids and bases in water and their ability to generate H+ or OH- ions.
   - Brønsted-Lowry theory: It emphasizes the ability of substances to donate or accept protons. Acids are characterized by their ability to donate protons, while bases are characterized by their ability to accept protons.

Overall, the Brønsted-Lowry theory provides a more general and comprehensive understanding of acid-base reactions, encompassing a wider range of solvents and emphasizing the role of proton transfer. It builds upon the concepts introduced by the Arrhenius theory and extends them to include reactions and substances beyond aqueous solutions.

### The pH scale

- pH: the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution

$$
pH = -log_{10}[H^{+}]
$$

![4_pH_scale](C:\Users\wongj\Documents\2023\Notes\Chemistry\assets\4_pH_scale.jpg)

##### pOH Scale (not important)

$$
pOH = -log_{10}[OH^{-}] \\
pH + pOH = 14 \\
pH = 14 - pOH
$$

- pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, while pOH measures the concentration of hydroxide ions. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating an acidic solution, values of 7 being neutral, and values above 7 being basic. The pOH scale works in a similar way, but in reverse.
- The sum of pH and pOH is always 14. This is because the product of proton concentration and hydroxide concentration must always equal the equilibrium constant for the ionization of water, which is equal to 10^−14^

### Indicators

  - acid into base: phenolphthalein
  - base into acid: methyl orange
  - The endpoint is not accurately 7

#### The Importance of water for acids

- The presence of water is essential for the formation of hydrogen ions and it is only the presence of these ions which causes acidity. Without water, an acid won't show the properties of acid.

- e.g. HCl~(g)~ behaves differently when dissolved in water and in an organic solvent.

#### Strong and weak bases

### Properties of alkalis





## Salts

### Definition

Salts are formed by the replacement of one or more hydrogen ions of an acid with metal ions or ammonium ion.

### Preparing Salts

#### Preparing Insoluble Salts / Precipitation Reaction

#### Preparing Soluble Salts

### Solubility

#### Dissolution process

- solution crystalize
  - rate of dissolution > rate of crystallizations
- dynamic equilibrium
  - rate of dissolution = rate of crystallization
  - the solution is saturated in that solute

#### Types of solution

1. unsaturated solution
2. saturated solution
3. supersaturated solution
   1. unstable, the presence of dust or the addition of a small quantity of solid solute can cause the excess solute to crystalize of from the solution

#### Solubility

The solubility of a substance is the quantity that dissolves to form a saturated solution. It is often expressed as grams of solute per 100g H~2~O. (x g / 100g H~2~O)
$$
\text{percentage by mass of the solution} = \frac{m(solute)}{m(solution)}
$$

#### Factors affecting Solubility

##### Temperature

- The solubilities of most molecular and ionic **solids** increase with increasing temperature
- All **gases** become less soluble in water as the temperature increases

- Temperature affects solubility because it influences the **kinetic energy** of molecules and their interactions. In general, increasing temperature leads to greater solubility for solids in liquids, while it decreases solubility for gases in liquids.

##### Pressure

- Pressure has practically no effect of the solubility of liquids and solids, but has a profound effect on the solubility of **gases**

- **Henry's Law** provides a mathematical relationship for the effect of temperature on the solubility of gases in liquids.
  $$
  C = kP
  \\ Solubility \propto kP
  $$
  
  - C is the concentration of dissolved gas
  - k is the Henry's Law constant characteristic of each specific gas
  - P is the partial pressure of the gas over the solution
  

#### Solubility Calculations

1. If 12.3g of lead(II) nitrate(V) were saturated in 21.0g of distilled water at 20°C, calculate the solubility of the solute. [58.6g/100g water]

2. At a given temperature, 730.cm³ of water were saturated with 6.35 moles of zinc nitrate(V). Calculate the solubility of the solute at that temperature, in grams per 100g of water. (Assuming that the density of water is 1g/ml) [164.40g]

3. The solubility of potassium chlorate(V) at 80°C is 40g per 100g water. 

   (a) What mass of the potassium chlorate(V) will saturate 65g of water at 80°C? [26g]

   (b) What mass of water will be saturated by 56g of potassium chlorate(V) at 80°C? [140g]

   (c) Calculate the mass of solute in 123g of saturated solution at 80°C. [35.14g]

4. The solubility of potassium nitrate(V) is 180g per 100g water at 83°C and 70g per 100g water at 40°C. Calculate the mass of potassium nitrate(V) that will crystallize out of solution if 155g of the saturated solution at 83°C cooled to 40°C. 

## Volumetric Analysis

### Acid-base titration

#### Detecting the end point

- The **end point** of a titration is the point at which the **indicator changes color**.
- Indicators are used to detect the end point. To be effective, an indicator must give a **sharp change in color**.

- **Phenolphthalein** and **methyl orange** are the two commonly used indicators. (Litmus and Universal Indicator are not used, as the changes in color at the end point are not sharp.)

|                     | Acidic    | Neutral   | Basic  |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ |
| **Phenolphthalein** | colorless | colorless | pink   |
| **Methyl orange**   | red       | yellow    | yellow |

### *Test of gases

#### H~2~

If hydrogen is present in a test tube, a burning splinter held near its mouth ignites with a squeaky pop sound.

#### O~2~

Use a glowing splinter insert into test tube. If the glowing splinter reignites, it's oxygen.

#### Cl~2~

Chlorine has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It makes damp blue litmus paper turn red, and then bleaches it white.
