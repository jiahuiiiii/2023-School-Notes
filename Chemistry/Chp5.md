# Chapter 5 - Redox Reactions and Electrolysis

- In Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) reactions, **electrons move** between atoms. Oxidation and reduction **happen at the same time**.
  - oxidation numbers will show you how the electrons are moving
- **Reduction: Gain of electrons**, oxidation number going down
- **Oxidation: Loss of electrons**, oxidation number going up
- *"OIL RIG": oxidation is loss, reduction is gain*
- eg: Na + Cl —> NaCl
  - Sodium is oxidized, it loses an electron. 
  - Chlorine is reduced, it gains an electron. 
  - <u>Half reactions</u>
    - oxidation: Na —> Na^+^ + e^-^ 
    - reduction: Cl + e^-^ —> Cl^-^

### Half equations / ionic half equations

Redox reactions involving a transfer of electrons can be split into two halves.

- Oxidation half-equation
- Reduction half-equation

#### Steps 

1. Balance all atoms other than H and O. 
2. Balance for O by adding H2O to the side with less O.
3. Balance for H by adding H+ to the side with less H.
4. Balance for charge by adding electrons (e^-^) to the side with greater positive charge

#### Practise

ps 5&6

- *The method is only used for aqueous substances, solid/liquid/gas state substances don't require this method. You can straightaway get the answer.

## Oxidizing Agents and Reducing Agents

- An oxidizing agent makes oxidation happens.
- An reducing agent makes reduction happens.
- The thing that is oxidized is the reducing agent.
- The thing that is reduced is the oxidizing agent.

### Test for a reducing agent

#### Acidified potassium *dichromate(VI)* solution

(K~2~Cr~2~O~7~ solution with some **dilute sulfuric acid** added)*potassium dichromate(VI) itself is an oxidizing agents

- It is **orange** in color. When it reacts with a reducing agent, it is reduced. Its color changes from orange to **green** due to the formation of chromium (III) ions, Cr^3+^~(aq)~

- $$
  \ce{Cr2O4^{2-}_{(aq)} + 6e- + 14H+_{(aq)} ->2Cr^{3+}_{(aq)} + 7H2O_{(l)}}
  $$

e.g. When SO~2(g)~ is bubbled into acidified potassium potassium dichromate(VI) solution

- Chemical equation
- Ionic equation
- Observation

#### Acidified potassium *manganate(VII)* solution

(KMnO~4~ solution with some **dilute sulfuric acid** added)*potassium manganate(VII) itself is an oxidizing agents

- It is **purple** in color. When it reacts with a reducing agent, it is reduced. Its color changes from purple to **very pale pink** due to the formation of manganese (II) ions, Mn^2+^~(aq)~

- $$
  \ce{MnO4-_{(aq)} + 5e- + 8H+_{(aq)} -> Mn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 4H2O_{(l)}}
  $$

- *It needs sufficient amount of hydrogen ions, or else it will produced MnO~2~ brown precipitate due to not complete reduction.

e.g. When oxalic acid (H~2~C~2~O~4~) is added into acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution

- Chemical equation
- Ionic equation
- Observation

### Test for an oxidizing agent

#### Potassium Iodide solution

- It's **colorless**. When it reduces another substance, the iodide ions are oxidized to form **brown** iodide in aqueous solution.

- $$
  \ce{2I-_{(aq)} -> I2_{(aq)} + 2e-}
  $$

e.g. When H~2~O~2(aq)~ is added into acidified potassium iodide solution.

- Chemical equation
- Ionic equation
- Observation

### Practice

1. [UEC 2006-29] In an experiment, 50mL of 0.020 mol L-1 acidified iron (II) sulphate is quantitatively oxidized by X mL of 0.020 mol L¹ potassium permanganate. What is the value of X in mL? Ans:10

2. Orange ammonium dichromate (VI) crystals have the formula (NH4)2Cr2O7. When the crystals are heated, the products are steam, nitrogen, and green chromium (III) oxide. 

   (a) Construct the equation, with state symbols, for the reaction.

   (b) Use the concept of oxidation states to explain whether the chromium in ammonium dichromate (VI) is oxidized or reduced in this reaction.

## Electrolysis

- They're not spontaneous. (This process doesn't happen on its own.)
- The electrical energy from a battery can force this process to happen.
