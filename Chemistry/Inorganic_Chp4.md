# Chapter 4 - Nitrogen and Its Compounds

## Nitrogen

- Nitrogen has an electronic configuration of 2.5, thus, it can
  - gain three electrons to form the nitride ion, N^3-^, e.g. Mg~3~N~2~
  - form covalent bonds, e.g. N~2~, NH~3~
- role in lives of people
  - essential part of all living organisms, present in protein
  - essential part of many explosives

### Laboratory Preparation

1. Preparation of nitrogen by the action of heat on ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite

   $$
   \ce{NaNO2_{(aq)} + NH4Cl_{(aq)} ->[\Delta] NaCl_{(aq)} + N2_{(g)} + 2H2O_{(g)}} \\
   (\ce{NaNO2_{(aq)} + NH4Cl_{(aq)} ->[\Delta] NaCl_{(aq)} + NH4NO2_{(aq)\,[unstable]}})
   $$

2. Preparation of nitrogen by action of ammonia gas on copper(II) oxide

   $$
   \ce{3CuO_{(s)} + 2NH3_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 3Cu_{(s)} + N2_{(g)} + 3H2O_{(l)}}
   $$

3. Preparation of nitrogen by action of air on copper (*extra one jit mentioned in class)

### Industrial Preparation

- **Air** is **liquefied** under pressure. When liquefied air is distilled, **liquid nitrogen boils first at -196°C** and oxygen boils off at -183°C. This process is known as **fractional distillation**.

### Physical Properties

1. Colorless, odorless, tasteless. A suffocating gas, don't support life, but not poisonous.
2. Slightly lighter than air.
3. Slightly soluble in water. Two volumes of the gas dissolves in 100 volumes of water at room temperature.
4. Melts at -210°C, boils at -196°C under atmospheric pressure.

- Nitrogen is chemically very inert under ordinary conditions.
- At very high temperature and pressure, nitrogen combines directly with hydrogen, oxygen and some metals to form compounds.

#### Reaction with metals

- Nitrogen combines directly with some metals, e.g. Ca, Mg, Al, Sr, Ba, Zn and Fe, to form **nitrides**.

- e.g. 1 Red hot magnesium combines directly with nitrogen to produce magnesium nitride. The nitride is **hydrolyzed** (water[OH^-^] is added) when it is **warmed** together with a little **water**, and **ammonia gas** is produced. 
  $$
  \ce{2Mg_{(s)\,[red\,hot]} + N2_{(g)} -> Mg3N2_{(s)\,[greenish\,yellow\,solid]}} \\
  \ce{Mg3N2_{(s)} + 6H2O_{(l)} ->[\Delta] 3Mg(OH)2_{(s)} + 2NH3_{(g)}}
  $$

- e.g. 2
  $$
  \ce{2Al_{(s)} + N2_{(g)} -> 2AlN_{(s)}} \\
  \ce{AlN{(s)} + 3H2O_{(l)} ->[\Delta] Al(OH)3_{(s)} + NH3_{(g)}}
  $$

#### Reaction with hydrogen

- Nitrogen combines reversibly with hydrogen. (**Haber Process**)

#### Reaction with oxygen

- Nitrogen combines with oxygen at very high temperature (about 2000°C) to form small amounts of nitrogen monoxide. In nature, this occurs in the atmosphere during lightning flashes.
  $$
  \ce{N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} ->[2000°C] 2NO_{(g)}}
  $$

### Test for Nitrogen

- At ordinary temperatures, nitrogen is so inert that no positive tests can be applied. We can only show a given gas to be nitrogen by elimination of other possibilities.

### Uses

1. Manufacture of ammonia, cyanides (CN^-^) and cyanamide (CNO^-^, an important fertilizer)
2. Cooling agent
3. Preservative to prevent rancidity (due to the oxidation of fats) in packaged foods.
4. Carrier gas in gas chromatography
