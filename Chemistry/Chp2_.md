## Chemical Bonds

![Chemical Bonds Summary](https://i.ibb.co/m0zkM5Z/2-summary-of-chemical-bondings.png)

- Chemical bonding involves the outer electrons of each atom

### Covalent Bonding

![NaCl](https://i.ibb.co/MPCLNFz/2-nacl-dot-and-cross.jpg)

A covalent bond is the **electrostatic attraction force** between the **nuclei of adjacent atoms** and **shared electron pairs**

- *electrostatic forces*: strong forces of attraction between particles with opposite charges

#### Simple Molecular Elements

##### Single Covalent Bonding

- Example: Hydrogen

  - Hydrogen normally exists in the form of *diatomic molecules* (H~2~)

  ![Hydrogen Bond](https://i.ibb.co/JCPngkf/2-hydrogen-bond.png)

  - Two atoms bond together by sharing their electrons
  - The orbits overlap each other and a bond is formed
  - Through this sharing, each atom gains a share in two electrons, which is the number of electrons in the nearest noble gas (helium) to hydrogen.
  - In a hydrogen molecules, the electrons are more likely to be found between the two nuclei.
  - The forces of attraction between the shared electrons and the nuclei are greater than any repulsive foces
  - The molecule is held together by the bond.

- Many non-metallic elements form diatomic molecules.

  - Halogens form covalent molecules.

    ![Halogens Bond](https://i.ibb.co/93NCLMX/2-halogens-bond.png)

  - Each atom gains a share in eight electrons in its outer shell.

- Molecules of **hydrogen** and the **halogens** are held together by a **single covalent bond**.

  - Such a single bond uses two electrons, one from each atoms.

    - displayed formula: a single line between the two atoms
    - *Lewis structure(dot-and-cross diagram)*: only the outer electrons are shown


##### Multiple Covalent Bonding

- When molecules of oxygen (O~2~) or nitrogen (N~2~) are formed, more electrons have to be used in bonding if the atoms are to gain a share of eight electrons

  ![Multiple Covalent Bonding](https://i.ibb.co/gtNSrWn/2-multiple-covalent-bonding.png)

- These molecules are held together by a double bond (O~2~) or a triple bond (N~2~).

#### Physical properties of simple covalent compounds

| Physical properties of simple covalent compounds             | Reasons for these properties                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Often liquids or gases at room temperature and have **low meting points and boiling points** | They are made of simple covalent molecules. The intermolecular forces are very weak. Not much energy is needed to move the molecules further apart. |
| **Do not conduct electricity**                               | There're no free electrons or ions present to carry the electrical current. |

### Ionic Bonding

- Compounds formed between a **metal** and **non-metal** generally involve ionic bonding.
- *Octet rule*: the tendency for atoms in compound to achieve noble gas configuration with eight valence electrons
- The **electrons** involved in the formation of ions are those in the **outer shell** of the atoms.
- **Metal** atoms lose outer electrons to form positive ions (**cations**).
- **Non-metal** atoms (except hydrogen) gain electrons to form negative ions (**anions**).
- The ions formed a **more stable electronic configuration**, usually that of the **nearest noble gas** to them in the Periodic Table.
- Ionic bonds result from the **electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions**.
- We use **Lewis structure (dot and cross diagram)** to show the outer electrons that have taken part in the bonding

#### Physical properties of ionic compounds

| Physical properties of typical ionic compounds               | Reasons for these properties                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| They have **high melting points and boiling points.**        | Ions are attracted to each other by strong electrostatic forces. Large amounts of energy are needed to separate them. |
| They are crystalline **solids** at room temperature.         | There is a regular arrangement of the ions in a lattice. Ions with opposite charge are next to each other. |
| They are often **soluble in water** (not usually soluble in organic solvents) | Water (polar) is attracted to charged ions and therefore an ionic solids dissolve. |
| They **conduct electricity** when **molten** or **dissolved in water** (not when solid). | In the liquid or solution, the ions are free to move about. They can move towards the electrodes when a voltage is applied. |
