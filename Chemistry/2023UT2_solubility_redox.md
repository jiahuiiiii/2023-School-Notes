### Solubility

#### Dissolution process

- solution crystalize
  - rate of dissolution > rate of crystallizations
- dynamic equilibrium
  - rate of dissolution = rate of crystallization
  - the solution is saturated in that solute

#### Types of solution

1. unsaturated solution
2. saturated solution
3. supersaturated solution
   1. unstable, the presence of dust or the addition of a small quantity of solid solute can cause the excess solute to crystalize of from the solution

#### Solubility

The solubility of a substance is the quantity that dissolves to form a saturated solution. It is often expressed as grams of solute per 100g H~2~O. (x g / 100g H~2~O)
$$
\text{percentage by mass of the solution} = \frac{m(solute)}{m(solution)}
$$

#### Factors affecting Solubility

##### Temperature

- The solubilities of most molecular and ionic **solids** increase with increasing temperature
- All **gases** become less soluble in water as the temperature increases

- Temperature affects solubility because it influences the **kinetic energy** of molecules and their interactions. In general, increasing temperature leads to greater solubility for solids in liquids, while it decreases solubility for gases in liquids.

##### Pressure

- Pressure has practically no effect of the solubility of liquids and solids, but has a profound effect on the solubility of **gases**

- **Henry's Law** provides a mathematical relationship for the effect of temperature on the solubility of gases in liquids.
  $$
  C = kP
  \\ Solubility \propto kP
  $$

  - C is the concentration of dissolved gas
  - k is the Henry's Law constant characteristic of each specific gas
  - P is the partial pressure of the gas over the solution

#### Solubility Calculations

1. If 12.3g of lead(II) nitrate(V) were saturated in 21.0g of distilled water at 20°C, calculate the solubility of the solute. [58.6g/100g water]

2. At a given temperature, 730.cm³ of water were saturated with 6.35 moles of zinc nitrate(V). Calculate the solubility of the solute at that temperature, in grams per 100g of water. (Assuming that the density of water is 1g/ml) [164.40g]

3. The solubility of potassium chlorate(V) at 80°C is 40g per 100g water. 

   (a) What mass of the potassium chlorate(V) will saturate 65g of water at 80°C? [26g]

   (b) What mass of water will be saturated by 56g of potassium chlorate(V) at 80°C? [140g]

   (c) Calculate the mass of solute in 123g of saturated solution at 80°C. [35.14g]

4. The solubility of potassium nitrate(V) is 180g per 100g water at 83°C and 70g per 100g water at 40°C. Calculate the mass of potassium nitrate(V) that will crystallize out of solution if 155g of the saturated solution at 83°C cooled to 40°C. 

## Volumetric Analysis

### Acid-base titration

#### Detecting the end point

- The **end point** of a titration is the point at which the **indicator changes color**.
- Indicators are used to detect the end point. To be effective, an indicator must give a **sharp change in color**.

- **Phenolphthalein** and **methyl orange** are the two commonly used indicators. (Litmus and Universal Indicator are not used, as the changes in color at the end point are not sharp.)

|                     | Acidic    | Neutral   | Basic  |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ |
| **Phenolphthalein** | colorless | colorless | pink   |
| **Methyl orange**   | red       | yellow    | yellow |

### *Test of gases

#### H~2~

If hydrogen is present in a test tube, a burning splinter held near its mouth ignites with a squeaky pop sound.

#### O~2~

Use a glowing splinter insert into test tube. If the glowing splinter reignites, it's oxygen.

#### Cl~2~

Chlorine has a characteristic sharp, choking smell. It makes damp blue litmus paper turn red, and then bleaches it white.

# Chapter 5 - Redox Reactions and Electrolysis

- In Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) reactions, **electrons move** between atoms. Oxidation and reduction **happen at the same time**.
  - oxidation numbers will show you how the electrons are moving
- **Reduction: Gain of electrons**, oxidation number going down
- **Oxidation: Loss of electrons**, oxidation number going up
- *"OIL RIG": oxidation is loss, reduction is gain*
- eg: Na + Cl —> NaCl
  - Sodium is oxidized, it loses an electron. 
  - Chlorine is reduced, it gains an electron. 
  - <u>Half reactions</u>
    - oxidation: Na —> Na^+^ + e^-^ 
    - reduction: Cl + e^-^ —> Cl^-^

### Half equations / ionic half equations

Redox reactions involving a transfer of electrons can be split into two halves.

- Oxidation half-equation
- Reduction half-equation

#### Steps 

1. Balance all atoms other than H and O. 
2. Balance for O by adding H2O to the side with less O.
3. Balance for H by adding H+ to the side with less H.
4. Balance for charge by adding electrons (e^-^) to the side with greater positive charge

#### Practise

## Oxidizing Agents and Reducing Agents

- An oxidizing agent makes oxidation happens.
- An reducing agent makes reduction happens.
- The thing that is oxidized is the reducing agent.
- The thing that is reduced is the oxidizing agent.

### Test for a reducing agent

(K~2~Cr~2~O~7~ solution with some **dilute sulfuric acid** added)*potassium dichromate(VI) itself is an oxidizing agents

- It is **orange** in color. When it reacts with a reducing agent, it is reduced. Its color changes from orange to **green** due to the formation of chromium (III) ions, Cr^3+^~(aq)~

- $$
  \ce{Cr2O4^{2-}_{(aq)} + 6e- + 14H+_{(aq)} ->2Cr^{3+}_{(aq)} + 7H2O_{(l)}}
  $$

#### Acidified potassium *manganate(VII)* solution

(KMnO~4~ solution with some **dilute sulfuric acid** added)*potassium manganate(VII) itself is an oxidizing agents

- It is **purple** in color. When it reacts with a reducing agent, it is reduced. Its color changes from purple to **very pale pink** due to the formation of manganese (II) ions, Mn^2+^~(aq)~

- $$
  \ce{MnO4-_{(aq)} + 5e- + 8H+_{(aq)} -> Mn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 4H2O_{(l)}}
  $$

- *It needs sufficient amount of hydrogen ions, or else it will produced MnO~2~ brown precipitate due to not complete reduction.

e.g. When oxalic acid (H~2~C~2~O~4~) is added into acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution
