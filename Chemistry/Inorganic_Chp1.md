# Chapter 1 - Metal Activity Series

## Reactivity of Metals

- The **greater** a metal's **tendency** to form positive ions [*electropositivity*], the **more reactive** it is.

#### Reactivity Series

$$
K\;Na\;Li\;Ca\;Mg\;Al\;[C]\;Zn\;[H_2]\;Fe\;Sn\;Pb\;[H^{+}]\;Cu\;Hg\;Ag\;Pt\;Au
$$

- Carbon is placed between aluminum and zinc because it can reduce zinc oxide to form zinc but cannot reduce aluminum oxide. Metals below carbon in the series can be extracted by heating their oxides with **carbon,** but those above carbon must be extracted by **electrolysis**.
- Same goes to hydrogen gas. It can reduce Iron(II/III) oxide to form iron but cannot reduce zinc oxide.
- The order of reactivity can be determined from experimental observations
  - reaction of metals with cold water or steam
  - reaction of metals with dilute acids

### Reactions of Metals with Air (Oxygen)

1. ***Potassium and sodium*** **burn** readily and **violently** with air to form **white peroxides**.
   $$
   \ce{K_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} -> K2O2_{(s)}} \\
    \ce{K_{(s)} + \underset{excess}{O2_{(g)}} -> \underset{postassium superoxide}{KO2_{(s)}}} \\
    \ce{Na_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] Na2O2_{(s)}}
   $$

   - Metals appear **dull** when exposed to air. Hence they have to be **stored under oil**.

   - The oxides are **basic** in nature and **soluble** in water forming **alkalis** (soluble hydroxides).
     $$
     \ce{K2O_{(s)} + H2O_{(l)} -> 2KOH_{(aq)}} \\
     \ce{Na2O_{(s)} + H2O_{(l)} -> 2NaOH_{(aq)}} \\
     $$

2. ***Calcium and magnesium*** burn **vigorously** in air to from **white oxides**.
    $$
    \ce{2Ca_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2CaO_{(s)}} \\
    \ce{2Mg_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2MgO_{(s)}} \\
    $$

    - Metals appear **dull** when exposed to air due to the layer of oxide on the surface.

    - The oxides are **basic** in nature and **sparingly soluble** (low solubility) in water forming **hydroxides**.
      $$
      \ce{\underset{quick lime}{CaO_{(s)}} + H2O_{(l)} -> \underset{slaked lime}{Ca(OH)2_{(s)}}} \\
      \ce{MgO_{(s)} + H2O_{(l)} -> Mg(OH)2_{(s)}} \\
      $$

3. ***Aluminum, zinc and iron*** also burn if they're **strongly heated** (particularly in oxygen)
    $$
    \ce{4Al_{(s)} + 3O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] \underset{white solids}{2Al2O3_{(s)}}}\\
    \ce{2Zn_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2ZnO_{(s)\,[white\,when\,cold,\,yellow\,when\,hot]}}\\
    \ce{2Fe_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2FeO_{(s)}}\\
    \ce{3Fe_{(s)} + 2O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] \underset{black crystals}{Fe3O4_{(s)}}}\\
    $$

    - The oxides of **aluminum and zinc** are amphoteric in nature and are insoluble in water.
    
      - **Amphoteric oxides** can react with both acids and alkalis to produce salts and water as the only products.
    
    - The oxides layer of **aluminum and zinc** formed adheres to the surface and serves as a **protective layer** against further oxidation. [**Passivation**]
    
    - Iron (II) oxide can be further oxidized to iron (III) oxide (under high temperature).
      $$
      \ce{4FeO_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2Fe2O3_{(s) [reddish\,brown\,powder]}}
      $$
    
    - The layer of oxide formed by **iron** is soft and falls off, exposing fresh metallic surface for **further oxidation**.

4. ***Tin, lead, copper and mercury*** have very little reaction with air. **Strong heating** is required and the **layer of oxide** normally forms on the **surface** only. (they **do not burn**)
$$
  \ce{2Sn_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2SnO_{(s)\,[black\,insoluble \,amphoteric\,oxide]}} \\
  \ce{2Pb_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2PbO_{(s)\,[yellow\,insoluble \,amphoteric\,oxide]}} \\
  \ce{2Cu_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2CuO_{(s)\,[black\,insoluble \,basic\,oxide]}} \\
  \ce{2Hg_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] 2HgO_{(s)\,[reddish\,insoluble \,basic\,oxide]}} \\
$$


5. ***Silver and gold*** have **no reaction** with air even on strong heating.

## Thermal Decomposition of Metallic Compounds

### Metal Oxides

- Most metal oxides are stable to heat except HgO and Ag~2~O.
  $$
  \ce{2HgO_{(s)} ->[\Delta] 2Hg_{(l)} + O2_{(g)}} \\
  \ce{Ag2O_{(s)} ->[\Delta] 2Ag_{(s)} + 1/2O2_{(g)}}
  $$

### Metal Hydroxides

- Most metal hydroxides decompose into their **metallic oxides** and **water**.

![i1_Thermal Decomposition of Metal Hydroxides](https://i.ibb.co/k1Mp4fz/i1-Thermal-Decomposition-of-Metal-Hydroxides.png)

### Metal Nitrates

- All metal nitrates decompose on heating. (They are best stored in an amber glass bottle or compatible opaque plastic container.)
- When metal nitrates(V) in solid form are strongly heated, they **decompose differently** according to their **thermal stability**.

### Metal Carbonates

![i1_Thermal Decomposition of Metal Carbonates](https://i.ibb.co/2jk4mQ9/i1-Thermal-Decomposition-of-Metal-Carbonates.png)

## Reduction of Metal Oxides

- A metal oxide may be reduced to the metal by:
  1. reaction with other metals higher in the reactivity series.
  2. reaction with non-metallic reducing metals e.g. carbon, carbon monoxide, hydrogen.
  3. heating the oxide
- The method of reduction depends on the position of the metal in the reactivity series.

### Reaction with other metals higher in reactivity series

- A metal higher in the series can reduce the oxide of a metal that is lower in the series.

  e.g.
  $$
  \ce{Zn_{(s)} + CuO_{(s)} ->[\Delta] ZnO_{(s)} + Cu_{(s)}}
  $$
  

#### Thermit Reaction 铝热反应

- When **aluminum powder** is used to **reduce the oxides of metals** lower in the reactivity series, the process is known as the thermit process. The reaction is **highly exothermic**.

  e.g.
  $$
  \ce{2Al_{(s)} + Fe2O3_{(s)} ->[ignite] 2Fe_{(l)} + Al2O3_{(s)}}
  $$
  
- The generated heat is so high that the **iron** obtained in the **molten state**. This process is often used in **welding**.

- In the laboratory, the process can be started by burning a piece of magnesium ribbon (as fuse导火索) in the mixture of iron(III) oxide and aluminum. At the end of the reaction, a lump of solid iron will be obtained at the bottom of the crucible upon cooling. (https://youtu.be/EDUwc953GOA?si=FtgYp70yrAUEswub)

### Reaction with non-metallic reducing agents

$$
K\;Na\;Li\;Ca\;Mg\;Al\;[C]\;Zn\;[H_2]\;Fe\;Sn\;Pb\;[H^{+}]\;Cu\;Hg\;Ag\;Pt\;Au
$$

#### With Carbon

- Industrially, carbon in the form of coke (contains about 80%-85% carbon) is used to reduce zinc oxide to zinc.

- Zinc is the highest metal in reactivity series to be reduced by coke.
  $$
  \ce{C_{(s)} + ZnO_{(s)} -> Zn_{(s)} + CO_{(g)}}
  $$

- Oxides of metals higher than carbon cannot be reduced by carbon.

![i1_The reactions of some metal oxides with carbon](https://i.ibb.co/QYXGs6d/i1-The-reactions-of-some-metal-oxides-with-carbon.png)

#### With Hydrogen

- At **Bunsen burner temperature**, hydrogen will reduce iron(III) oxide and oxides below it in the reactivity series

  e.g.
  $$
  \ce{\underset{yellow}{PbO_{(s)}} + H2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] \underset{grey globules}{Pb_{(s)}} + H2O_{(g)}} \\
  \ce{\underset{black}{CuO_{(s)}} + H2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] \underset{brownish}{Cu_{(s)}} + H2O_{(g)}} \\
  \ce{\underset{reddish-brown}{Fe2O3_{(s)}} + 3H2_{(g)} ->[\Delta] \underset{silvery grey}{2Fe_{(s)}} + 3H2O_{(g)}} \\
  $$
  

### By heating the oxide

- Mercury(II) oxide and silver oxide are reduced by heating.
  $$
  \ce{2HgO_{(s)} ->[\Delta] 2Hg_{(l)} + O2_{(g)}} \\
  \ce{2Ag2O_{(s)} ->[\Delta] 4Ag_{(s)} + O2_{(g)}}
  $$
  

## Extraction of Iron —— The Blast Furnace

- Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace. 
- The main iron ore is called haematite. **Haematite** contains mainly **iron (III) oxide - Fe~2~O~3~**. The iron ore contains impurities, mainly **silica (silicon dioxide)**. **Limestone (calcium carbonate)** is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silicate in the blast furnace. The **calcium silicate** (called **slag**) floats on the liquid iron. Since iron is below carbon in the reactivity series, iron in the ore is reduced to iron metal by heating with **carbon (coke).** It is actually carbon monoxide which does the reducing in the blast furnace.

![i1_blast_furnace](https://i.ibb.co/dBJqrnC/i1-blast-furnace.png)

- The key features of the blast furnace extraction of iron from iron ore (hematite) are:
  - the burning of carbon (coke) to provide heat and produce carbon dioxide
  - the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide
  - the reduction of iron(III) oxide by carbon monoxide
  - the thermal decomposition of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce calcium oxide (lime)
  - the use of limestone to remove the main impurity (sand) as slag (calcium silicate).

#### Chemistry of the Blast Furnace

- ***Hot air (<u>oxygen</u>)*** is blasted into the furnace causing ***coke (<u>carbon</u>)*** to burn rapidly and raise the temperature to about 1800°C. The carbon dioxide then reacts with hot carbon to form ***<u>carbon monoxide</u>***.
  $$
  \ce{C_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} -> CO2_{(g)} + heat} \\
  \ce{CO2_{(g)} + heat -> C_{(s)} + O2_{(g)}}\\
  $$

- Carbon monoxide then **reduces iron** in the ore (***<u>haematite, magnetite</u>***) to iron metal. 
  $$
  \ce{3CO_{(g)} + \underset{haematite}{Fe2O3_{(s)}} -> 2Fe_{(l)} + 3CO2_{(g)}} \\
  \ce{4CO_{(g)} + \underset{magnetite}{Fe3O4_{(s)}} -> 3Fe_{(l)} + 4CO2_{(g)}}
  $$

- The temperature where the reduction takes place is above 600°C, **Iron falls to the bottom** of the furnace where the temperature is 1800°C. Iron is **liquid** at this temperature and is tapped off periodically. Iron formed in blast furnace is ***<u>pig iron</u>*** which contains C (3.8-4.7%), Mn, Si, S and P. 

- Melting point of pig iron is 1000-1300°C, much lower than pure iron, which is 1535°C. 

- ***<u>Limestone</u>*** is calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (as **flux**) and it is added to the blast furnace to **remove the impurities** in the iron ore. Calcium carbonate is decomposed by heat in the furnace to give **<u>*calcium oxide (quicklime)*</u>** and carbon dioxide. 
  $$
  \ce{CaCO3_{(s)} ->[\Delta] CaO_{(s)} + CO2_{(g)}}
  $$
  
- The **main impurity is silica (sand or rock)** which is ***silicon dioxide***. Silicon dioxide is solid at the furnace temperature and the furnace would become blocked if it was not removed. Silicon dioxide reacts with calcium oxide to form <u>***calcium silicate** (**slag**)*</u> which is **liquid** in the furnace. Slag flows to the bottom of the furnace where it **floats on the liquid iron** and is easily removed. 
  $$
  \ce{CaO_{(s)} + SiO2_{(s)} ->[\Delta] CaSiO3_{(l)}}
  $$
  
- **Slag layer protects the underlying iron from oxidation by the hot air blast.** Slag periodically tapped off from the iron and solidified, is used for road surfacing, cement manufacture, as insulating material.

- The **blast furnace gas** contains CO, CO~2~, N~2~ and etc.
