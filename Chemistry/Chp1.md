## Classification of Matter

### States of Matter

- Matters have **volume** & **mass**
- Matter can exist in three different **physical states**: **solid**, **liquid**, **gas**
- The states of matter can be changed by changing the **temperature** and/or **pressure**
  - Changes in pressure of temperature have greater impact on **gas**

|          Physical State           |            solid            |         liquid         |            gas             |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------: |
|              Volume               |        fixed volume         |      fixed volume      |      no fixed volume       |
|              Density              |            high             |    moderate to high    |            low             |
|               Shape               |         fixed shape         |     no fixed shape     |       no fixed shape       |
|             Fluidity              |        does not flow        |    generally flows     |        flows easily        |
|             Movement              | vibrate in a fixed position |      free to move      |        move freely         |
|             Particles             |       closely packed        | slightly further apart | far apart from one another |
| Attraction Force & Kinetic Energy |          E~k~ < F           |        E~k~ â‰ˆ F        |          E~k~ > F          |

- Attraction forces (F) between the particles won't change, but the kinetic energy (E~k~) of particles will be affected by heat. 

### Particles

- There're three types of particles that made up matters: **atoms**, **molecules**, **ions**

![1_particles_of_matter](https://i.ibb.co/3fw1yB8/1-particles-of-matter.png)

## The Change of State of Matter

- All states of matter show an increase in volume (**expansion**) when the **temperature** is **increased** and a decrease in volume (**contraction**) when the **temperature** is **lowered**
- Large **increases/decreases** in **temperature** and **pressure** can cause a substance to **change** its **physical state**

![1_change_of_states](https://i.ibb.co/xX9jrbn/1-change-of-states.png)

### Boiling & Evaporation

- **Evaporation** take place over a range of temperatures, only take place from the surface of the liquid
  - the rate of evaporation may be affected by the temperature and surface area
  - *volatile*: term that describes a liquid that evaporates easily
    - usually a liquid with low boiling point because there're weal intermolecular forces between the molecules in the liquid
- **Boiling** takes place at a **specific temperature**

### Sublimation

- Example of substances that sublimes: 
  - iodine, dry ice (solid CO~2~), mothballs, ammonium chloride (NH~4~Cl)
- Ammonium chloride doesn't REALLY sublime, at a certain temperature, it decomposes to ammonia and hydrogen chloride (both gases), which appears to be sublimation but is not.
- Iodine can exist in liquid state. The iodine seems to miss out the liquid stage if heated strongly because the temperature rises very quickly, the m.p. and b.p. are close together, the liquid stage is not seen as it boils quickly
  - To make iodine melt to form a liquid at atmospheric pressure: 
    - heat the solid slowly
    - use some tools(electrical heater, oil bath) to control the rise of temperature carefully

### Heating and Cooling Curves

![1_heating_curve](https://i.ibb.co/SfC27Vr/1-heating-curve.png)

- The **temperature stays constant** during the state changes.
- During heating, all the energy absorbed at m.p. and b.p. goes into weakening the attraction forces between particles without temperature rise.
- During colling, all the heat energy released at condensation point and freezing point is given out into increasing of the intermolecular forces without temperature falls.
- *exothermic changes*: freezing, condensing
- *endothermic changes*: melting, boiling, evaporation

### Effect of impurities

- **A pure substance melts and boils at definite temperature**.
- The presence of any **impurity** will **lower the freezing/melting point** of the solid
  - It makes it harder for the particles to arranged closely in fixed positions which is necessary if a substance is changed into a solid
  - It disrupts the formation of the lattice of the solid, less energy is required to break the lattice, this leads to a lower melting point
  - *lattice*: a regular 3D arrangement of particles in a crystalline solid
- The presence of any **impurity** will **increase the condensing/boiling point** of the liquid
  - It makes it harder for the particles to gain high kinetic energy which is necessary if a substance is changed into a gas/vapour(mixture of two states)
  - the molecules need more energy(heat) than normal in order to escape from the liquid and become vapour.
- Thus, **purity of substance** is checked by **determining the m.p. and b.p.**
- These values can also be used to **identify an unknown substance**.

## Structure of Atoms

### The Historical Development of Atomic Model

1. John Dalton
   - atomic model: all matter was made up of atoms
2. J.J. Thomson
   - plum pudding model: discovered electron(negatively charged particles)
3. Ernest Rutherford
   - Rutherford model: discovered protons(positively charged particles) and nucleus
4. Niels Bohr
   - Bohr model / planetary model: electrons move in specific energy levels or "shells" around the nucleus of an atom
5. James Chadwick
   - discovered the neutron(electrically neutral / no electrical charge)
   - completing the picture of the three main *subatomic particles* that make up atoms

### Characteristics of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons

| Subatomic Particle | proton(p)  | neutron(n) |         electron(e)         |
| :----------------: | :--------: | :--------: | :-------------------------: |
|   Relative Mass    |     1      |     1      |    1 / 1840 (negligible)    |
|  Relative Charge   |     +1     |     0      |             -1              |
|  Location in Atom  | in nucleus | in nucleus | surrounding/outside nucleus |

- **Atoms are electrically neutral**, so every atoms have an **equal number of protons and electrons** to cancel out the charges
- The **number of neutrons** required to hold the nucleus together **increases** as the **atomic size (atomic number) increases**
  - **Hydrogen** atom is the only atom that has **no neutron**
  - Neutrons are important in making the nucleus of an atom stable
    - Protons are positively charged and would therefore repel each other. 
    - The presence of the neutrons counteracts this repulsion and means that the nucleus can hold together.

#### Example: Helium

![1_helium_subatomic_particles](https://i.ibb.co/pZBZq8F/1-helium-subatomic-particles.png)

### Atomic Number and Mass Number

- We can represent a particular atom of an element by combining the chemical symbol of the element with the nucleon(A) and atomic(Z) numbers of the atom.

$$
\ce{^{A}_{Z}X}
$$

- Example: representing the structure of iodine atoms, using the above format

  - $$
    \ce{^{127}_{53}I} \\
    Iodine-127
    $$

- Atomic number / proton number (Z) = number of protons in the nucleus of an atom

- Nucleon number / mass number (A) = number of protons + number of neutrons

- number of electrons = number of protons = atomic number

- number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number (A-Z)

### Isotopes

- *Isotopes* are atoms of the same element that have the **same proton number** but a **different nucleon number**. Many Isotopes are **radioactive** because their nuclei are unstable (radioisotopes).

- Many elements have naturally occurring isotope. 

- Hydrogen, the simplest element, has two naturally occurring isotopes: hydrogen and deuterium. A third Isotope, tritium, can be made artificially.

  ![1_hydrogen_isotopes](https://i.ibb.co/2W6MS4x/1-hydrogen-isotopes.png)

- The isotopes of an element have the **same chemical properties**. 

  - Isotopes have the **same electronic configuration**. It determine the way it forms bonds and react with other atoms.

- The isotopes **differ in some of their physical properties** (such as density, rate of diffusion)

  - Examples
    - difference in density between ordinary ice and heavy-water ice(deuterium oxide, D~2~O)
    - radioactivity of tritium and carbon-14 (radioisotopes)

#### Relative Atomic Mass (A~r~)

- A single atom cannot be weighed on a balance.

- Masses of all atoms are compared to the mass of a **carbon-12 atom**.

- One atom of carbon-12 is given the mass of 12 precisely.

- $$
  \text{1 atomic mass unit (a.m.u)} = \frac{1}{12} \times \text{mass of one atom of carbon-12}
  $$

- Examples of value obtained for other element

  - | Element  | Atomic Symbol | Relative Atomic Mass (A~r~) |
    | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
    | carbon   | C             | 12                          |
    | hydrogen | H             | 1                           |
    | copper   | Cu            | 64                          |

- **Most elements exist naturally as a mixture of isotopes**, therefore, the value we use for the **atomic mass** of an element is an **average mass**.
  $$
  A_r(X) = (\text{isotope}_1\text{ abundace} \times \text{mass of }\text{isotope}_1) + (\text{isotope}_2\text{ abundace} \times \text{mass of }\text{isotope}_2)
  $$

- Examples

  - Iridium has two isotopes. These isotopes are iridium-191 and iridium-193. A natural sample of iridium consists of 37.3% of iridium-191. 

  - $$
    \begin{align*}
    A_r(Ir) &= (191 \times 37.3\%) + (193 \times (100-37.3)\%) \\
    &= (191 \times 37.3\%) + (193 \times 62.7\%) \\
    &= 192.254
    \end{align*}
    $$

### Electronic Configuration of Elements

#### Bohr's atomic theory

- electrons are in **orbit** around the central nucleus of an atom
- the electron orbits are called **electron shells / energy levels** and have different energy
- **shells that are further from the nucleus have higher energies**
- the shells are filled starting with the one with lowest energy (closest to the nucleus)
- the first shell can hold only two electrons
- the outermost shells can hold eight electrons to give a stable arrangement of electrons
- If the number of electrons of an atom is more than 20, the third shell will hold 18 electrons. If the numbers of electrons is 20 or less, the third shell will hold 8 electrons
- **electron arrangement / configuration**: the way in which the electrons are distributed in the shells of an atom

##### Example of Electron Configurations of The First 20 Elements

| Element    | Symbol | Atomic Number (Z) | Electron configuration |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| hydrogen   | H      | 1                 | 1                      |
| boron      | B      | 5                 | 2.3                    |
| oxygen     | O      | 8                 | 2.6                    |
| neon       | Ne     | 10                | 2.8                    |
| magnesium  | Mg     | 12                | 2.8.2                  |
| phosphorus | P      | 15                | 2.8.5                  |
| potassium  | K      | 19                | 2.8.8.1                |

##### Periodic Table

- The electron configuration of an element determines the group number and period number of that element in the periodic table

## Chemical Formulae

### Nomenclature of Inorganic Compounds

#### Binary Covalent Compounds

- Covalent / molecular compounds are form when nonmetal elements bond to each other

- The first element in the formula is simply listed using the name of the element. 

- The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix -ide. 

- A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule.

  | Atoms in Compound | Prefix on the Name of the Element             |

#### Ionic Compounds

- Ionic compounds are formed when metal atoms lose one or more of their electrons to nonmetal atoms.

- Ionic compounds are made up of ions.

- Some elements can form two different ions, we can use two ways too distinct them:

  - **Stock System** (Modern approach)
  - Common System

  | Ion    | stem  | charge | modern name    | common name |
  | ------ | ----- | ------ | -------------- | ----------- |
  | Iron   | ferr- | 2+     | iron(II) ion   | ferrous ion |
  |        |       | 3+     | iron(III) ion  | ferric ion  |
  | copper | cupr- | 1+     | copper(I) ion  | cuprous ion |

### Nomenclature of Acids

#### Acids that doesn't Contain Oxoanion

- Naming as Ionic compounds

  - first write the cation(usually hydrogen), then write the anion
  - Ionic name is preferred when the compound is not acting as an acid
    - i.e. pure HCl in gas phase

- Naming as Acids

  - Add prefix hydro- to the name of anion, then replace the last syllable from â€“ide to â€“ic acid. 
  - Acid name is preferred when the compound acts as an acid
    - particularly when it is in solution form in water

- Examples

  | Compounds | name(aqueous)      | name(gas)         |
  | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
  | HCl       | hydrochloric acid  | hydrogen chloride |

  | HI        | hydroiodic acid    | hydrogen iodine   |
  | *HCN      | hydrocyanic acid   | hydrogen cyanide  |

  - all above the above are binary acids, except HCN
